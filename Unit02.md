    Previewing helps you get a better idea of what you’re going to be
    reading. Since this is an art book, follow the link in the text box
    at right and spend some time examining the 16 accompanying
    paintings. Also, read the titles to the book’s 15 chapters listed in
    the “Stream Audiobook” box on Books Should be Free.

    -   What do you notice about the way the authors chose to organize
        the information in the book?
    -   What places are mentioned?
    -   What historic periods are referenced?
    -   What ideas do you already have about *The Book of Art for Young
        People*?

     Instructions: Read Chapter 1, the introduction to the book. As you
    read the first few paragraphs, think about the authors’ purpose, an
    idea we explored in Unit 1.

    -   What did the authors want you to think about?
    -   Why did they compare storytelling and art? Were they attempting
        to persuade, entertain, inform, or describe?
    -   Can you identify evidence to support your choice?

    You should note that the first and second chapters do not discuss
    specific paintings, but the remaining chapters do.  
      
     It should take approximately 20 minutes to read Chapter 1.

     Instructions: Distinguishing between fact and opinion is a
    necessary reading skill. As you are reading through *The Book of Art
    for Young People*, pay close attention to what the author states as
    fact, which can be proven, and opinion, which is subjective. Words
    like, “most,” “best” “worst,” “beautiful,” and “ugly” can be hard to
    qualify. The graphic organizer, linked above, can help you keep
    track of some of the more notable facts and opinions you come
    across. Print out a copy for note-taking as you read through the
    book.  
        
     It should take approximately 10 minutes to read the information
    about the graphic organizer, and print out a copy for note-taking.

    idea for a speech. You can talk about anything you like - maybe a
    special person or place, or maybe you’ll talk about a topic or
    activity that’s important to you. For this activity, the focus is on
    learning how to format and deliver a speech. Select a topic you
    already know a lot about so you can place all of your energy on
    learning the proper format for a speech.
