Eighth-grade English Language Arts will provide you with a strong
foundation for high school. Grounded in Common Core State Standards, the
content of this course emphasizes critical reading, writing, and
thinking. You will read and analyze high-quality literary and
informational texts. You will write original texts in multiple genres.
Language and its conventions will be emphasized throughout, and
opportunities to examine the spoken word will be provided as well.
Whether you choose to pursue higher education or the world of work, or
both, you will be expected to have certain basic skills in reading,
writing, speaking and listening. While you probably won’t be expected to
write a poem on command, you will have to be able to express yourself
clearly when you write and speak. This course includes challenging
material which will help you build the skills you need to begin high
school. As you progress through your remaining years as a student, you
will continue to add and build upon the skills and knowledge you gain
from this course.

### Course Information

Welcome to Grade 8 English Language Arts. This course consists of five
thematic units. Each unit utilizes high quality literary works to help
you build your reading skills. There are several writing tasks, intended
to review skills you have probably already learned, while also learning
important new concepts. Speaking, listening, and language skills are
incorporated into each unit.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Ms. Tracy
Derrell](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#MsTracyDerrell)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course has been created using free online
texts and tutorials. All of the texts come from [Books Should Be
Free](http://www.booksshouldbefree.com/), while most of the tutorials
are from [SOPHIA](http://www.sophia.org/) and
[MERLOT](http://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm) (Multimedia Educational
Resource for Learning and Online Teaching).  
  
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to successfully complete this
course, you will need to work through all of the assigned readings and
associated tasks. In addition to the assignments, which will help you
learn the skills and concepts from each unit, you will need to complete
brief assessments. Each unit includes two assessments, one focusing on
reading and writing, and the other one focusing on speaking, listening,
and language. Though the final exam will be the only graded task,
completing the assignments and assessments is necessary, as they will
help you evaluate your learning.  
    
 In order to pass the course, you must earn a grade of 70% or higher on
the final exam. You may take the exam more than once, if necessary.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **Completing this course should take you a total of
approximately **69 hours**. Each unit includes a “Time Advisory” that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. It
is recommended you devote about an hour a day, five days a week, to
working your way through the course. This is the same amount of time
you’d spend in a typical English class. If you are able to complete your
studying at the same time every day, this will go a long way toward
helping you develop strong study habits.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** There will be many occasions where you will need
to take notes, and you will also frequently be writing responses to
literature. You should have an ample supply of pens and pencils, as well
as paper. A loose-leaf notebook may provide you with the most
flexibility for organizing your notes; making a divider for each unit is
a good idea. Some of the readings will be challenging; if needed, you
can complete them in multiple sittings.   
  
 *How to take notes in a digital text:*  
  
 [**Scrible**](http://www.scrible.com/#news)  
 If you are using a computer, you can use Scrible, which is a toolbar
that you save as a link. It allows you to edit any webpage by
highlighting sections, leaving notes, changing the color of text, and so
forth. As you work your way through Saylor’s courses, Scrible allows you
to leave the pen and notepad at home and take notes directly on the
screen you’re learning from. Save a tree and Scrible away!   
  
 **Adobe Reader
App **[**(Android)**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader&hl=en)** or **[**(iOS)**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-reader/id469337564?mt=8)  
 If you are using an iPad, iPhone, or any android type device, you can
use the Adobe Reader app. Similar to Scrible, the Adobe Reader app will
allow you to highlight, draw on, and add text to PDFs (one form of media
Scrible does not work on). For example, say you’re taking [K12ELA11:
American Literature](http://www.saylor.org/courses/k12ela11/) which
relies heavily on Scott McLean's *Writing for Success* text, one of
Saylor.org’s many complete texts available on
our [Bookshelf](http://www.saylor.org/books/). If you had this app
downloaded to your mobile device, you could import that PDF text
and voilà!  
 It’s easy to mark up the text for later review.  
    
 [**VideoNot.es**](http://www.videonot.es/)  
 This has the same idea as Scrible and the Adobe Reader App, but this
tool lets you take notes on videos. With this tool, you can say goodbye
to constantly pausing the video lecture you’re watching to take notes.
It features side-by-side note taking, and it’s all saved in the cloud!  
    

[**GoodNotes**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-free-take-notes/id483679173?mt=8)  
 If you have an iPad, you may want to use GoodNotes, which is an app
that allows you to write notes, highlight text, and export your files to
Dropbox for continued use on other devices. GoodNotes also allows you to
import files from iTunes, which means you can access all Saylor files
currently uploaded to iTunes U.  
    
 [**Evernote**](https://evernote.com/)  
 Evernote is an app available for Windows, Macintosh, Android, and iOS
devices. The app allows you to import documents that you can then
annotate, highlight, and save for later reference. Evernote also updates
documents across all of your devices, so if you are working on your iPad
and decide to switch to your computer, you can start right where you
left off.  
    
 [**NOOK**](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/Compare-NOOKs/379003181)  
 If you have a NOOK tablet, you can create notes and highlight text
right in the device. Just right click inside a text and begin writing
notes. If you want to highlight, you can drag your finger across the
text, and right click to highlight.
