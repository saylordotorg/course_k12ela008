*Many students your age are curious about otherworldly topics and creepy
stories. This unit provides those things, along with opportunities to

Connan Doyle. Both of these classic short stories are as popular today
as they were when they were published, inspiring many modern writers.*

of the stories, such as characterization or plot development, to
analyze.*   
  
 *One of the stories will be presented in an audio format, giving you a
chance to improve your listening skills. You will continue to develop
and reinforce your ability to correctly use conventions of language, as
well as adding new words to your vocabulary.*

Stories*: “The Belief in Ghosts in Ancient Greece and Rome”** <span
id="4.1"></span> 
*This unit will continue the course’s emphasis on informational text
with a social studies-related reading. Though the question of ghosts
cannot be definitively answered, ancient cultures had some very clear
ideas about ghosts. The excerpt you are going to read discusses
attitudes toward ghosts in ancient Greece and Rome.*

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read Chapter 2. You will
    follow up this reading by completing an activity that asks you to
    compare Greek or Roman beliefs about ghosts with your own culture’s
    ideas about ghosts. As you read, pay close attention to aspects of
    the text that you can compare and contrast.  
        
     It should take approximately 30 minutes to read this chapter from
    *Greek and Roman Ghost Stories*.

    “Comparing and Contrasting Informational Texts.” When you’re
    finished, create a Venn diagram where you compare and contrast
    either Greek or Roman beliefs about ghosts with your own culture’s
    beliefs. You don’t need to do research for your part; work with your
    own understanding and knowledge.  
        
     It should take approximately 45 minutes to review the tutorial and
    create your graphic organizer.
