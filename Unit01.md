**Unit 1: Rising To Challenges** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit features a full-length classic novel,* The Swiss Family
Robinson*, and excerpts from a nonfiction work,* South: Journal of His
Last Expedition to Antarctica, *by Ernest Shackleton. Both texts deal
with people facing challenges to their survival.*  
    
 *In addition to addressing the theme of survival, both texts feature
people facing challenges. Your reading of these stories will be extended
by a narrative, or story, you’ll write about a challenge you faced. You
will review the steps of the writing process, from pre-writing, to
drafting, to editing and revising, to publishing. You will begin this
essay during this unit and complete it during Unit 2.*  
    
 *As you read the selected texts, you will encounter many new words.
This unit will also emphasize vocabulary and teach you strategies you
can use for understanding new words while you read. The strategies you
learn in this unit will help you throughout the course.*  
    
 *Finally, you will also receive what is likely a reintroduction to the
writing process. You will begin working on a full-length narrative essay
that will be concluded during Unit 2. This will provide you with an
opportunity to fully absorb the information. The language aspect
emphasizes vocabulary, where you will learn strategies for understanding
new words that you will use throughout the entire course. *

**1.1 Reading Informational Text: Excerpts from *South: Journal of His
Last Expedition to Antarctica* by Ernest Shackleton, Chapter 3: “Winter
Months”** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*You will read a key section from the nonfiction book,* South: Journal
of His Last Expedition to Antarctica*, by Ernest Shackleton. This text
was chosen as an excellent example of informational text; it will also
help you develop background about history and notable explorers. As you
read through the selection, you will build reading comprehension and
analysis skills, which you will continue to develop throughout the
course. *

**1.1.1 Reading Comprehension** <span id="1.1.1"></span> 
*This part of the subunit will emphasize important comprehension skills.
You will view and listen to a tutorial that shares information about
these skills. After completing the tutorial, you will practice the
skills by reading the excerpt from* South: Journey of His Last
Expedition to Antarctica.

    organize your notes chronologically, or in time order, to make it
    easier to relocate the parts of the text the notes refer to.  
        
     It should take approximately 20 minutes to read through the
    tutorial, listen to the audio component, and to take notes.

     Instructions: Read the document, which gives some great strategies
    for finding writing ideas. There are two practice activities, which
    are modified to fit our purpose. Since your narrative is going to be
    about a challenge you faced, make a list of three or four possible
    ideas. Use one of those ideas for “Practice I: Freewriting.” Use
    another idea for “Practice II: Idea Wheel.” If one of those ideas
    seems to generate enough potential for your essay, move on to
    “Practice III: Moving From Pre-Writing to Writing.”  
        
     It should take approximately 30 minutes to read through the
    material and complete Practice I and Practice II. If you need to
    complete Practice III, add on an additional 15 minutes.  
      
     Though this is a large chunk of time, planning your writing before
    you begin is an important investment and will likely result in a
    better finished product.

*The ability to identify new works and use them to create meaning as you
read are essential to reading comprehension. This unit, although focused
on language, also has a strong connection to comprehension. The skills
you work on in this unit will help you as a reader by giving you
strategies for working with unfamiliar words. You will also review the
different types of reference books you will encounter as you continue
your education. These books are available electronically and also
potentially available in your library as printed copies.*

    use to define unfamiliar words in context. Print out a copy (or two)
    of the worksheet, and as you encounter words you don’t know, use the
    worksheet to help you determine a workable definition. When you use
    context clues, you don’t have to come up with a perfect dictionary
    definition; you just need the gist of the word. Going to a
    dictionary should be your last resort.  
        
     It should take approximately 5 minutes to define each unfamiliar
    word.

the following list will help you. It contains books and other resources
you can use for further study. You will most likely be able to find many
of these items in your local public library. *

-   **Reading: *The Revenge of the Whale: The True Story of the
    Whaleship Essex* by Nathaniel Philbrick**
    This is the true story of an 1820s whaling ship that was rammed and
    sunk by an angry whale. Twenty-one crew members, including a
    14-year-old boy, escaped into three lifeboats. *The Revenge of the
    Whale* tells the story of the crew’s struggle to stay alive while
    adrift at sea.

-   **Reading: *Amelia Lost: The Life and Disappearance of Amelia
    Earhart* by Candace Fleming**
    This book, which mixes narrative and informational text, tells the
    story of American aviator Amelia Earhart, whose feat as one of the
    first women to fly a plane was eclipsed by her mysterious and
    unsolved disappearance. To this day, the story of her final flight
    continues to captivate readers.

-   **Reading: *Hole in My Life* by Jack Gantos**
    Jack Gantos is best known as the author of the *Joey Pigza* and
    *Rotten Ralph* books. This memoir for young adults tells the story
    of a part of his life that most of his young fans probably know
    nothing about. In 1972, Gantos, then 20, began a six-year prison
    sentence after being convicted of drug smuggling. *Hole in My Life*
    tells the story of that bleak period and how books and writing
    helped Gantos survive and make a life for himself after prison.

-   **Reading: *The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle* by Avi**
    Thirteen-year-old Charlotte Doyle was supposed to sail from England
    to her family in America with two families her parents trusted.
    However, an unexpected turn of events places her on a ship with an
    angry captain and mutinous crew. When Charlotte is accused of the
    captain’s murder, she must use all of her resources to prove her
    innocence and stay alive until she gets home to her family. This
    exciting tale has many twists and turns.
