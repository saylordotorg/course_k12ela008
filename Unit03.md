**Unit 3: What is Courage?** <span id="3"></span> 
*You will gain critical reading and viewing skills in this unit, with a
focus on true stories. This unit’s materials feature two important
periods in American history.* Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl *by
Harriet Jacobs is a first-person account of a young woman’s life in
slavery. In addition to this text, you will examine letters from World
War II, from soldiers to their loved ones, and study some of the
persuasive posters that were used to inspire patriotism and boost morale
during the war. The letters and posters will give you the opportunity to
explore nontraditional texts that still convey important stories and
information. As with the previous units, the texts will give you the
chance to practice important reading comprehension and literary analysis
skills.  
    
 This unit’s writing task is an argumentative essay. You may already
have some topics you feel strongly about; if so, you should jot some of
them down now for future exploration. If you don’t have any ideas now,
you will have time when you get to that part of the unit. You will also
learn about the difference between verbs and verbals and the importance
of subject-verb agreement.  
    
 You will also get the chance to incorporate art into your study of
language and literature by creating a persuasive poster. This project
will require you to use critical thinking skills as you figure out how
to visually represent your message. *

you will continue to develop reading comprehension and literary analysis
skills. You should have a notebook nearby as you read so you can note
anything you want to remember or write about in more detail at a later
time.*

    what you already know about slavery, specifically the day-to-day
    experiences of slaves. Then, read Chapter 1 through Chapter 12.
    After you complete a chapter, summarize the main idea of that
    chapter in a sentence or two.

letters will provide you with a firsthand account of wartime
experience.*

**3.2.1 Reading Comprehension** <span id="3.2.1"></span> 
*In this part of the unit, you will be introduced to a new type of
informational text: letters. You will read two letters written during

    your preferred format from the “View the Book” box on the left side
    of the page. The letter details Vonnegut’s experiences as a POW
    (prisoner of war) during the last months of World War II.  
      
     As you read, think about what his letter is mostly about. In your
    notebook, describe the main idea of the letter in a short paragraph.
    Then explain whether or not you feel some of Vonnegut’s details were

*Argumentative essay writing is the focus of this subunit. Knowing how
to craft a strong argument by organizing your key points and
anticipating counterarguments is an important skill. You will be
supported through this process by an excellent tutorial that breaks down
the information so it’s more manageable. You will revisit this tutorial
throughout the process, focusing on different parts of it as you work.
Note: We will not be studying the tutorial in order. It seemed to make
more sense to address counterarguments sooner rather than later.*

    with the rubric for support is a great way to help you strengthen
    your paper. When you have finished, you will have a solid idea of
    what you need to work on in order to write a better paper. After you
    have identified your paper’s strengths and weaknesses, use that
    information to help you write a second draft.

    counterargument was effective, or maybe you want to make sure you
    described your topic well.
